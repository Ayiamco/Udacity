# Landing Page Project 

This is my submission for my second project during my Udacity front end nano degree program. The page was built  using HTML,CSS and Javascript. 

I was given a base design which was done with only HTML and CSS. I had to use javascript to do the following; 

1. Add a navigation bar
2. Add css designs for elements entering the viewport
3. Add a button that enables the user scroll back to top. The button would always be visible.
